  Still want to play football, but dont have the same stamina and pace that you once had? Then walking football is ideal for you. We meet at the Arbroath high scool sport centre every wednesday, the session costs Â£2.50 and starts at 19.15 for an hour, but we would appreciate it if you were there for 19.00, this helps us sort out the admin and gives us the full hour for playing. We are a non profit club, any money left over from the hire costs will be used for the benefit of the club.
